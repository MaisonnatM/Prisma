## Code point of view

I used generic components of my own project that I don't use here to their full potential as well as tokens that I didn't modify to not waste time.
Some pieces of code could also have been made generic and the env variables in an .env but the idea was to respect the 4 hours delay.

## Technology used

- React
- NextJS
- EmotionJS
- Typescript
